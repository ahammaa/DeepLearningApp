This mini project is used for Image Classification using the deep learning technique Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
The used dataset is MNIST dataset, which stands for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database. It is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.
Keras API is used. Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.
